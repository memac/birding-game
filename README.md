Welcome to Digital birding, a game that lets you relive the fun of birding from your couch

The Watcher is controled with the Alt and Ctrl keys.  He only moves left and right along the ground.  

The pointer is controled by the arrow keys.  It represents where the watcher is looking.  It can move left, right, up and down.  It can even move diagonally
The pointer stays with the watcher when the watcher moves.

The pointer can only travel a certain distance from the the watcher.  To reach birds further away, press the space bar.  This is similar to using your binoculars.

If you release the space bar while the pointer far away from the watcher, the pointer returns to the watcher himself.

The pointer must touch the birds to "collect" them.  This level is complete when all birds are collected.

Have fun.
